- The code is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3
- In Python 2 some warnings may appear due to the Pandas Library that I have used.
  As it turns out from this link, these warnings are apparently benign: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40845304/runtimewarning-numpy-dtype-size-changed-may-indicate-binary-incompatibility
- I have printed and plotted the absolute value of the relative error as I felt that the result was more interpretable that way.
